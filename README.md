# Personal-Hub

## Description

We wanted to create a little personalized hub where you get all your information all at once just by opening the wesbite. 
Our inspiration came from a program kind of like Notion. 
We wanted to create it to see if we can come uo with something that felt more like a mancave. A cozy informational hangout space.

We had to implement multiple API's to display information like sports scoreboards, weather forecast, historical facts, and stocks to give you information you need.
